# Critique report and recovery

Before running any `node <scripts_dir>` command, use
`materialize_skill_scripts(name="impeccable")` and set
`environment.PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR` from its result.

### Generate Combined Critique Report

Synthesize both assessments into a single report. Do NOT simply concatenate. Weave the findings together, noting where the LLM review and detector agree, where the detector caught issues the LLM missed, and where detector findings are false positives.

The chat response is the primary user-facing deliverable. Present the full structured critique below in chat; do not replace it with a summary and a link. The persisted snapshot is only an archive/backlog for later commands.

Structure your feedback as a design director would:

#### Report header provenance

The report's first line MUST declare how the assessments were run, so a degraded run is never silent:
- Dual-agent: `Method: dual-agent (A: <agent-id> · B: <agent-id>)`
- Degraded: `⚠️ DEGRADED: single-context (<reason, e.g. no sub-agent tool exposed>)`

#### Design Health Score
> *Consult `references/critique-scoring.md` when assigning heuristic scores or severity.*

Present the Nielsen's 10 heuristics scores as a table:

| # | Heuristic | Score | Key Issue |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | ? | [specific finding or "n/a" if solid] |
| 2 | Match System / Real World | ? | |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | ? | |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | ? | |
| 5 | Error Prevention | ? | |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | ? | |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency | ? | |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | ? | |
| 9 | Error Recovery | ? | |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | ? | |
| **Total** | | **??/[applicable max]** | **[Rating band]** |

The applicable maximum is 4 times the number of heuristics you actually scored: **/40** when all ten apply, **/32** when two are `n/a`. Never print `/40` over a partial set.

Be honest with scores. A 4 means genuinely excellent. Most real interfaces score 20-32 out of 40.

**Mode applicability**: heuristics 7 (Flexibility and Efficiency) and 10 (Help and Documentation) may be scored `n/a` on Persuade and Experience surfaces (landing pages, campaigns, portfolios, bodies of work), as may any other heuristic that genuinely cannot apply to the surface under review. Write `n/a` in the Score cell with a one-line reason, and renormalize the total to the applicable maximum (e.g. **24/32** when two heuristics are n/a) so the rating band stays proportional. The persisted snapshot must record the applicable maximum and which heuristics were scored n/a.

#### Design Specificity Verdict

**Start here.** Does the result feel authored for this product, or category-interchangeable?

**LLM assessment**: Your unanchored evaluation of design specificity. Cover overall coherence, structural sameness, category-interchangeable choices, and missed opportunities for product character.

**Deterministic scan**: Summarize what the automated detector found, with counts and file locations. Note any additional issues the detector caught that you missed, and flag any false positives.

**Browser evidence** (if browser automation was available): Summarize what visual inspection showed at representative viewports, with screenshots where the harness supports them. If browser inspection was attempted but failed, say that no reliable browser evidence is available and report the fallback signal instead.

#### Overall Impression
A brief gut reaction: what works, what doesn't, and the single biggest opportunity.

#### What's Working
Highlight 2-3 things done well. Be specific about why they work.

#### Priority Issues
The 3-5 most impactful design problems, ordered by importance.

For each issue, tag with **P0-P3 severity** from `references/critique-scoring.md`:
- **[P?] What**: Name the problem clearly
- **Why it matters**: How this hurts users or undermines goals
- **Fix**: What to do about it (be concrete)
- **Suggested command**: Which command could address this (from: `adapt`, `animate`, `audit`, `bolder`, `clarify`, `colorize`, `critique`, `delight`, `distill`, `harden`, `layout`, `optimize`, `overdrive`, `polish`, `quieter`, `shape`, `typeset`)

#### Persona Red Flags
> *Consult `references/critique-personas.md` when testing multiple user perspectives.*

Auto-select 2-3 personas most relevant to this interface type. If `.impeccable.md` contains a `## Design Context` section (written by `impeccable teach`), also generate 1-2 project-specific personas from the audience/brand info.

For each selected persona, walk through the primary user action and list specific red flags found:

**Alex (Power User)**: No keyboard shortcuts detected. Form requires 8 clicks for primary action. Forced modal onboarding. High abandonment risk.

**Jordan (First-Timer)**: Icon-only nav in sidebar. Technical jargon in error messages ("404 Not Found"). No visible help. Will abandon at step 2.

Be specific. Name the exact elements and interactions that fail each persona. Don't write generic persona descriptions; write what broke for them.

#### Minor Observations
Quick notes on smaller issues worth addressing.

#### Questions to Consider
Provocative questions that might unlock better solutions:
- "What if the primary action were more prominent?"
- "Does this need to feel this complex?"
- "What would a confident version of this look like?"

**Remember**:
- Be direct. Vague feedback wastes everyone's time.
- Be specific. "The submit button," not "some elements."
- Say what's wrong AND why it matters to users.
- Give concrete suggestions. Cut "consider exploring..." entirely.
- Prioritize ruthlessly. If everything is important, nothing is.
- Don't soften criticism. Developers need honest feedback to ship great design.

### Persist the Snapshot

Once the report above is finalized, write it to `.impeccable/critique/` so the user can refer back, and so the `polish` steering command (load via `get_skill_file(name="impeccable", path="references/polish.md")` on `gobby-skills`) can pick up the priority issues without a copy-paste.

Skip this step if the Setup slug was null (vague or root-level target).

1. **Write the body to a temp file** so you can pipe it to the helper. Use the full critique report (heuristic table, design-specificity verdict, priority issues, persona red flags, minor observations, and questions), but stop before the "Ask the User" / "Recommended Actions" sections that come later.

2. **Pass the structured metadata** through `IMPECCABLE_CRITIQUE_META` (JSON), then run the write command:
   ```bash
   IMPECCABLE_CRITIQUE_META='{"target":"<user phrasing>","total_score":<n>,"max_score":<n>,"na_heuristics":"<comma-separated numbers, or empty>","p0_count":<n>,"p1_count":<n>}' \
     node <scripts_dir>/critique-storage.mjs write "<resolved target>" <body-file>
   ```
   `max_score` is the applicable maximum from the heuristic table (40 when every heuristic applied), so a later run can tell a renormalized total from a full one. The helper prints the absolute path it wrote.

3. **Delete the temp body file** after the write attempt completes, whether the write succeeded or failed. If deletion fails, mention `temp-file cleanup failed: <reason>` briefly in the final output, but do not block the critique.

4. **Read the trend** for context:
   ```bash
   node <scripts_dir>/critique-storage.mjs trend "<resolved target>" 5
   ```
   This returns a JSON array of the last 5 frontmatter entries (including the one you just wrote).

5. **Append a single line to the user-visible output**, after the report and before the questions:

   > **Trend for `<slug>` (last 5 runs): 24 → 28 → 32 → 29 → 32 (out of 40)**
   > Wrote `.impeccable/critique/<filename>`.

   Read `max_score` on each trend entry. When every entry shares one maximum, state it once as above. When they differ, print each score with its own denominator (`24/32 → 30/40`) and note that the runs scored different heuristic sets, so the line is not a like-for-like comparison. Treat a missing `max_score` on an older entry as 40.

   If this is the first run for the slug, the trend is just one score; say so: "First run for this target, no trend yet."

This is fire-and-forget. Do not show the user the helper's JSON output; only the human-readable trend line and the written path. Failures here should not block the rest of the flow; print the error and move on.

### Ask the User

**After presenting findings**, use targeted questions based on what was actually found. Use the harness's structured question tool when available; otherwise ask in plain chat. These answers will shape the action plan.

Ask questions along these lines (adapt to the specific findings; do NOT ask generic questions):

1. **Priority direction**: Based on the issues found, ask which category matters most to the user right now. For example: "I found problems with visual hierarchy, color usage, and information overload. Which area should we tackle first?" Offer the top 2-3 issue categories as options.

2. **Design intent**: If the critique found a tonal mismatch, ask whether it was intentional. For example: "The interface feels clinical and corporate. Is that the intended tone, or should it feel warmer/bolder/more playful?" Offer 2-3 tonal directions as options based on what would fix the issues found.

3. **Scope**: Ask how much the user wants to take on. For example: "I found N issues. Want to address everything, or focus on the top 3?" Offer scope options like "Top 3 only", "All issues", "Critical issues only".

4. **Constraints** (optional; only ask if relevant): If the findings touch many areas, ask if anything is off-limits. For example: "Should any sections stay as-is?" This prevents the plan from touching things the user considers done.

**Rules for questions**:
- Every question must reference specific findings from the report. Never ask generic "who is your audience?" questions.
- Keep it to 2-4 questions maximum. Respect the user's time.
- Offer concrete options, not open-ended prompts.
- If findings are straightforward (e.g., only 1-2 clear issues), skip questions and go directly to Recommended Actions.

### Recommended Actions

**After receiving the user's answers**, present a prioritized action summary reflecting the user's priorities and scope from Ask the User.

#### Action Summary

List recommended commands in priority order, based on the user's answers:

1. **`<cmd>`**: Brief description of what to fix (specific context from critique findings)
2. **`<cmd>`**: Brief description (specific context)
...

**Rules for recommendations**:
- Only recommend commands from: `adapt`, `animate`, `audit`, `bolder`, `clarify`, `colorize`, `critique`, `delight`, `distill`, `harden`, `layout`, `optimize`, `overdrive`, `polish`, `quieter`, `shape`, `typeset`
- Order by the user's stated priorities first, then by impact
- Each item's description should carry enough context that the command knows what to focus on
- Map each Priority Issue to the appropriate command
- Skip commands that would address zero issues
- If the user chose a limited scope, only include items within that scope
- If the user marked areas as off-limits, exclude commands that would touch those areas
- End with `polish` as the final step if any fixes were recommended

After presenting the summary, tell the user:

> You can ask me to run these one at a time, all at once, or in any order you prefer.
>
> Re-run `critique` after fixes to see your score improve.
