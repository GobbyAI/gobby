# Critique workflow

### Purpose

Resolve one stable target, run two independent assessments, synthesize a design critique, persist a snapshot, and ask the user what to improve next. The chat response is the primary deliverable; the snapshot is an archive/backlog for future commands.

### Hard Invariants

- Assessment A (design review) and Assessment B (detector/browser evidence) are both required.
- Assessment A and B MUST run as two isolated sub-agents whenever a sub-agent/Task tool is exposed. Running them inline in this context is "possible" but is NOT permitted; it is a degraded run. Inline is allowed ONLY when no sub-agent tool exists (or the user declined, on harnesses that ask).
- If you degrade for any reason, the report's first line MUST be a banner: `⚠️ DEGRADED: single-context (<reason>)`. A silent degraded critique is a failed critique.
- Assessment A must finish before detector findings enter the parent synthesis context. Detector output is deterministic, but it still anchors judgment.
- A skipped detector is a failed critique run unless `detect.mjs` is missing or crashes after a real attempt.
- Viewable targets require browser inspection when available.
- Any local server started only for critique visualization must run in the background, have a recorded stop method, and be stopped before final reporting unless the user asks to keep it.
- Do not claim a user-visible overlay exists; the upstream overlay-injection flow is not vendored in Gobby. Report browser evidence as screenshots and console observations.

### Setup

1. **Resolve the target** to a concrete file path or URL. Prefer a source path over a dev-server URL when both identify the same surface; ports drift, paths do not.
   - "the homepage" -> `site/pages/index.astro` or `index.html`
   - "the settings modal" -> the primary component file
   - "this page" -> the current URL or source file
2. **Confirm the target slugs cleanly**:
   ```bash
   node <scripts_dir>/critique-storage.mjs slug "<resolved-path-or-url>"
   ```

   Resolve `<scripts_dir>` by calling `materialize_skill_scripts(name="impeccable")` on `gobby-skills`; it returns the absolute path of the skill's materialized `scripts/` directory. Export the returned `environment.PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR` before any browser-engine invocation. If the tool or Node is unavailable, skip detector runs and scan manually.

   Every later command also accepts the resolved target directly and derives the same slug internally; never hand-write a slug. If this exits non-zero, skip persistence and trend for this run, but continue the critique.
3. **Read `.impeccable/critique/ignore.md`** if it exists. Drop matching findings silently; it is the only prior-run input critique consumes.

### Assessment Orchestration

Delegate Assessment A and Assessment B to separate sub-agents. They must not see each other's output. Do not show findings to the user until synthesis.

Sub-agent gate (all harnesses):
- Spawn A and B as two isolated, parallel sub-agents whenever a sub-agent/Task tool is exposed. This is the default and is mandatory; do not run them inline because it is faster.
- "Unavailable" means exactly one thing: no sub-agent/Task tool is exposed in this session (or, on harnesses that ask, the user declined). It does not mean inconvenient.
- If and only if sub-agents are unavailable, fall back sequentially: finish and record Assessment A, then run Assessment B, then synthesize, and emit the degraded banner.
- Whichever path you take, declare it in the report header (see Report header provenance). Skipping sub-agents without the banner is the most common failure of this command.

If browser automation is available, each assessment creates its own new tab. Never reuse an existing tab, even if it is already at the right URL.

### Assessment A: Design Review

Read relevant source files and visually inspect the live page when browser automation is available. Think like a design director.

Evaluate:
- **Design specificity**: Is the composition, interaction, and visual language grounded in this product, or could an unrelated product use it unchanged? Make this judgment before seeing detector output.
- **Holistic design**: hierarchy, IA, emotional fit, discoverability, composition, typography, color, accessibility, states, copy, and edge cases.
- **Cognitive load**: consult the [Cognitive Load Assessment](#cognitive-load-assessment) section below; report checklist failures and decision points with >4 visible options.
- **Emotional journey**: peak-end rule, emotional valleys, reassurance at high-stakes moments.
- **Nielsen heuristics**: consult the [Heuristics Scoring Guide](#heuristics-scoring-guide) section below; score all 10 heuristics 0-4, marking any heuristic the mode-applicability rule allows as `n/a` instead of forcing a number.

Return: design-specificity verdict, heuristic scores, cognitive load, emotional journey, 2-3 strengths, 3-5 priority issues, persona red flags, minor observations, and provocative questions.

### Assessment B: Detector + Browser Evidence

Run the bundled detector and browser evidence. Assessment B is mandatory and must remain isolated from Assessment A until both are complete.

CLI scan:
```bash
node <scripts_dir>/detect.mjs --json [target]
```

- Pass markup files/directories as `[target]`; do not pass CSS-only files.
- For URLs, skip CLI scan and use browser inspection.
- For very large trees (500+ scannable files), narrow scope or ask.
- Exit code 0 = clean; 2 = findings.
- If the detector entrypoint is missing or fails to load, report deterministic scan unavailable and continue with browser/manual review.

Browser inspection is required for a viewable target when browser automation is available. Use a localhost dev/static URL for local files; avoid `file://` unless the available browser explicitly supports this workflow.

1. Create a fresh tab and navigate. Prefer the harness's native/browser-canvas screenshot path before hand-rolling a Playwright/Puppeteer script; only fall back to a custom script when no native browser tool is exposed.
2. Visually inspect the rendered page at representative viewport sizes and capture screenshots as evidence where the harness supports them.
3. The upstream live-overlay flow (script injection served by a live server) is not vendored in Gobby; do not attempt it. Report browser evidence as screenshots plus console observations instead.
4. For multi-view targets, inspect 3-5 representative pages.

Return: CLI findings JSON/counts, browser console findings if applicable, false positives, and skipped/failed browser steps with concrete reasons.

After Assessment B returns usable CLI findings, reuse them. Do not rerun `detect.mjs` in the parent unless Assessment B failed, was truncated, or omitted count, rule names, or file locations.

When both assessments are complete, call `get_skill_file(name="impeccable", path="references/critique-report.md")`. Follow it to synthesize the report, persist the snapshot, ask targeted questions, recommend repairs, and recover from persistence failures.
